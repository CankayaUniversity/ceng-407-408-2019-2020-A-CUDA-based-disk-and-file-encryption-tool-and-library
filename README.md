# A-CUDA based file encryption tool and library

A CUDA based disk and file encryption tool and library is encryption decryption library. We use PC's CPU and GPU for speed. It encrypts and decrypts in CPU or GPU according to file size. And your files will be securely encrypted and decrypted with the AES algorithm and CTR mode. With our project users canencrypt/decrypt their files faster and safer from other encryption/decryption libraries.

## Getting Started
